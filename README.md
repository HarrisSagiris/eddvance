Eddvance. What is eddvance ? 

Well, we all know that normal education gives the same ammount of work with the same style to every student
We also all know that nobody learns the same. There are : Visuall learners, audio learners, flashcard/excercises and more ! 

And that's why we decided to develop our platform. Eddvance. 
Eddvance enables teachers to work with students in a virtual environment to help students learn faster and easier with their style ! And the most important part is that teachers do NOT need to do any extra work ! they just upload their material and each student gets customised and tailored material for each student.
